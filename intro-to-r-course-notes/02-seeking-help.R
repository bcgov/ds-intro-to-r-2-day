## Finding help for functions in packages 
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------


## When you kind of remember the function 
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------


## When you have no idea where to begin 
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Challenge 1
# Look at the help for the `sum()` function. What are two ways you can pass numbers 
# into the function so the are added together?



#### Challenge 2
# Look at the help for the `paste()` function. You'll need to use this later.
# What is the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?



#### Challenge 3
# Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could
# use to load data from a csv file in which columns are delimited with "\t"
# (tab) and the decimal point is a "." (period). This check for decimal
# separator is important, especially if you are working with international
# colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the
# decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).
# hint: use `??csv` to lookup csv related functions.




#### Challenge 4
# Find the help for the `mutate` function in the `dplyr` package. 
# What is its purpose? What do you notice different about this help page?
