This folder contains the data (in the `data/` directory) as well as starter 
scripts that we will work through over the course of the workshop:

Data: 

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(paste("- `", list.files("data"), "`", collapse = "\n"))
```

R scripts:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(paste0("- `", list.files(pattern = "^[0-9]{2}_.*\\.R$"), "`", collapse = "\n"))
```
