# Applications of Rmarkdown

Now that we've learned the basics of R and Rmarkdown, we're going to tie some 
things together by doing a regression on the Gapminder data and displaying our
results in a nicely formatted document.

Working in a new Rmarkdown document (File -> New File -> Rmarkdown Document), 
we can load the libraries that we are going to use, and load the data in 
a code chunk:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r load}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

For now, we are just going to use the data for Canada, so let's insert a code
chunk to filter our data to just Canada:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r filter-can}
canada <- filter(gapminder, country == "Canada")
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

We want to do a regression investigating the relationship between life
expectancy and per-capita GDP in Canada. 

We can start by inserting another code chunk to do a quick visualization of the
data. We can insert the regression line on the points, but this doesn't give us
the regression coefficients, significance, etc. that we need to really evaluate
the relationship.

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r plot-1}
ggplot(canada, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

We use the `lm()` function to perform a General Linear Model (GLM), of which 
a regression is one form. It is specified by a new syntax, a "formula" syntax:

```r
lm(response ~ predictor(s), data = data, ...)
```

So in our case, we can put in a new code chunk to fit the model: 

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r model}
canada_lm <- lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp, data = canada)
summary(canada_lm)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

The `summary()` function gives us the high level information from our regression 
model: The coefficient estimates, the R-squared, and the p-value.

And the `plot()` function gives us some basic diagnostic plots:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r diagnostics}
plot(canada_lm)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

But these `lm` objects are ungainly - they are fine to look at to inspect the 
important parts of our model, but difficult to extract those pieces that we 
want to use later - such as regression coefficients and P values.

There is another package we can use, called *broom*, that is used to tidy
model results into a format we are familiar with: A `data.frame`:

You will first need to install the package:

```r
install.packages("broom")
```

Then add a chunk that loads the package, and calls the most commonly-used
functions in *broom*:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r diagnostics}
library(broom)
glance(canada_lm)
tidy(canada_lm)
augment(canada_lm)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

- `glance` gives us the model-level summary. The r-squared and adjusted r-squared, 
the F statistic, the P value, etc.
- `tidy` gives us the information for each term in the regression - in our 
case just the intercept and the estimated effect of life expectancy on per-capita GDP.
- `augment` gives us the estimated values of the response variable as predicted
by our model.

Now that these are in a data frame, we can use them more easily. Let's plot our 
regression line onto our plot:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = canada, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_line(data = model_predict, aes(x = lifeExp, y = .fitted))
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

Again, using the data frame containing our predicted values, we can calculate
the 95% confidence limits, and plot them as well:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
model_predict <- model_predict %>% 
  mutate(lower_ci = .fitted - 1.96 * .se.fit, 
         upper_ci = .fitted + 1.96 * .se.fit)

ggplot() + 
  geom_ribbon(data = model_predict, aes(x = lifeExp, ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(data = canada, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_line(data = model_predict, aes(x = lifeExp, y = .fitted))
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

If we compare this plot to the auto-generated line we added at the beginning of 
the lesson (using `geom_smooth()`), we see they are the same.

We can also pull out some of those model terms and report on them "reproducibly":

In our plot:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r lifeExp-stats, include=FALSE}
r2 <- round(model_summary$adj.r.squared, 2)
sig_0.05 <- ifelse(model_summary$p.value < 0.05, "p < 0.05", "p > 0.05")

ggplot() + 
  geom_ribbon(data = model_predict, aes(x = lifeExp, ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(data = canada, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_line(data = model_predict, aes(x = lifeExp, y = .fitted)) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 72, y = 30000), label = paste0("R^2 = ", r2, "; ", sig_0.05))
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

And in text:

<pre>
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r lifeExp-stats, include=FALSE}
life_exp <- filter(model_terms, term == "lifeExp")
life_exp_estimate <- round(life_exp$estimate, 1)
life_exp_se <- round(life_exp$std.error, 1)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>

```
The predicted effect of life expectancy on per-capita GDP is `r life_exp_estimate` 
(SE: `r life_exp_se`).
```
