# Create Tidy Data with tidyr

## Getting started








# ## Challenge 1
#
# Is gapminder a purely long, purely wide, or some intermediate format?




## From wide to long format with pivot_longer()























# ## Challenge 2
#
#  Using `gap_long_split`, calculate the mean life expectancy, population, and gdpPercap for each continent.
# **Hint:** use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions we learned in the `dplyr` lesson


## From long to intermediate format with pivot_wider()






















# ## Challenge 3
#
# Take this 1 step further and create a `gap_ludicrously_wide` format data by pivoting over countries, year and the 3 metrics?
#**Hint** this new dataframe should only have 5 rows.
