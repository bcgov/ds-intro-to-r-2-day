# Introduction to Data Science Using R

A repository to house materials for a 2 day course introducing participants to data science using [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

The goal of this 2 day workshop is to teach _new-to-programming_ data professionals to import data, clean up and summarize a data set, and make some static data visualizations using the program R. This is an introductory course to programming, specifically programming with R. R is a popular statistical computing language, commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis, generating production-quality graphics, and automating data workflow tasks. The workshop content will follow best practices for using R for data analysis, giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of R and scientific computing.

## Who should take this course?

- Anyone who works with data or who is interested in learning efficient ways to make meaning from data
- Anyone comfortable troubleshooting issues on their computer
- Anyone keen to learn a programming language
