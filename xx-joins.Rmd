# Joining Related Data

```{r, include=FALSE}

```
## Introducing Relational Data
In real life, we often have two or more related datasets that share a set of common columns.   We would like to combine these two datasets based on their common columns, known as **key** or **key variables**.

We may want to change a dataset by adding information from a second dataset.
For example, say we have a dataset containing employee information such as employee ID, 
name, job position, hire date, etc., and a second dataset containing the
current and historical wages for each job position. A relevant join -- adding a 
column of data for each row -- may be merging the current wage for each employee 
into the employee dataset.

We may also want to choose only a portion of a dataset. For example, one dataset
may include all students who ever attended a school along with their student ID, 
years attended, grades for each class, graduation date (if applicable), and so on,
whereas a second dataset may be simply a list of current students. A relevant join
-- retaining all columns of data, but for only specific rows -- may be a reduction 
of the first dataset for only those students currently in attendance, but with all 
their information (e.g., grades, etc.).

The first example is that of a **mutating join** - where we change one table 
by adding in data from a second table, based on matching through a key variable 
that exists in both tables. The second example is that of a **filtering join** - 
where we subset one table based on data in a second table, again based on matching 
through a key variable.

## Types of joins with dplyr

The `dplyr` package has several functions that allow us to make these joins. 
Assume we have tables _x_ and _y_.

There are four types of **mutating joins**, which add new variables to one 
table from matching rows in another:

* **inner joins** include all rows in x AND y

* **left joins** include all rows in x

* **full joins** include all rows in x OR y

* **right joins** include all rows in y

Note that left, full and right joins are also called _outer joins_.

There are two types of **filtering joins**, which filter observations from one 
table based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table:

* **semi joins** return all rows in x that HAVE a match in y

* **anti joins** return all rows in x that do NOT HAVE a match in y

The syntax for dplyr joins is simple: `xxx_join(x, y, by = "key_variable")`.

## Introducing the nycflights13 data

In prior lessons, you have seen datasets such as the gapminder and cat data. 
Now let's use a different dataset, from the `nycflights13` package^[Wickham H (2022). nycflights13: Flights that Departed NYC in 2013. R package version 1.0.2, https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13.], 
to explore relational data.

This package contains information about all flights that departed from 
New York City (e.g., EWR, JFK and LGA) to destinations in 2013. To help 
understand what causes delays, it also includes a number of other useful datasets:

* weather: hourly meteorological data for each airport
* planes: construction information about each plane
* airports: airport names and locations
* airlines: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

This diagram shows the relationships among the five datasets: 

![Source: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html](fig/xx-joins-fig1.png)

The key **variables** between flights and the *other datasets* are:

* flights dataset <- **origin** and **dest** both = **faa** -> *airports* dataset
* flights dataset <- **tailnum** -> *planes* dataset
* flights dataset <- **origin**, **year**, **month**, **day**, and **hour** -> *weather* dataset
* flights dataset <- **carrier** -> *airlines* dataset

## Getting started

First, install the packages if you haven't already done so (you probably
installed dplyr in a previous lesson):

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

Then, load the packages:

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
```

Let's take a peek at the main `nycflights13` dataset, "flights":

```{r}
flights
```

And get some more information about the flights dataset:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?flights
```

This tells us that the airline name, as opposed to a two-letter carrier abbreviation,
can be found in the `airlines` dataset, and that the `airports` dataset gives
more information on the flight destinations.

First, we will drop some variables from flights to make our work more evident.

```{r}
flights_mini <- flights %>% select(year:day, dep_delay, carrier:dest)
flights_mini
```

### Data analysis questions

How would we answer the following questions:

* what is the total number of flights per airline, but with 
the airline name showing instead of the carrier abbreviation?

* how many flights occurred when the temperature fell below freezing?

* are older planes more likely to have a delayed arrival?

Answering questions such as these requires us to join datasets.

## Using **left_join()**

The syntax for dplyr joins is: `xxx_join(x, y, by = "key_variable")`.

To answer the first question (i.e., number of flights per airline), we need
to join the flights and airlines datasets. We want a **left join** because we
want to add the airline names from airlines (as our second table) to flights 
(our first table). From above, we know that the flights dataset has a variable 
called 'carrier', and that that same variable is in the airlines dataset -- this
is our key (or "by" variable).

```{r}
left_join(x = flights_mini, y = airlines, by = "carrier")
```

We can see that the number of rows has stayed the same: 366,776, but that we 
have one new column (at the end) called "name".

Note that we could have instead used the pipe operator after summoning 'flights_mini'.

```{r}
flights_mini %>% left_join(y = airlines, by = "carrier")
```

Now, let's wrangle to get the total counts, by grouping by either carrier or the 
new "name" variable brought in from the airlines dataset. Note that we can also 
drop the argument names (e.g., no "y" in "y = airlines"). I tend to keep the 
"by" argument name in to keep my code a bit more clear.

```{r}
flights_mini %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(total_flights = n())
```

We can also rename variables within our join call. Let's rename "name" to 
"airline" (and sort descending by number of flights).

```{r}
flights_mini %>%
  left_join(airlines %>% select(carrier, Airline = name), by = "carrier") %>%
  ## make sure you use the new variable name
  group_by(Airline) %>%
  summarize(`Total Flights` = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Total Flights`))
```

>```
> </details>

One thing we haven't specifically noted is that mutating joins will bring in all
variables from the matching dataset. You'll see from the solution above that we
can change that behaviour by using `select()` and listing only those variables we 
want to join in (don't forget the key variable!).

### Modifying the `by` argument

#### > no by specification

We can modify the "by" argument a few ways. See what happens if we don't 
specify a `by` variable.

```{r}
## joining without specifying a `by` variable
left_join(flights_mini, airlines)
```

R will match by any variable with the same name in both datasets. Be careful - 
this might not be what you want!

```{r}
left_join(flights_mini, planes)
```

The variable "year" exists in both flights_mini and planes, but means different 
things. When not specifying the key, R assumed you wanted to join by "year" as
well, which resulted in a lot of NAs!

#### > multiple keys

You may have noticed earlier that we can join by more than one variable. To do
so, simply use `c("variable1", "variable2", "etc")` for your keys. Notice that 
year, month, day, and origin are in both the flights_mini and weather datasets.

```{r}
left_join(flights_mini, weather, by = c("year", "month", "day", "origin"))
```

You'll see that we now have over 8 million rows. This is because the "hour" 
variable in weather matched many times for each year X month X day X origin
combination, resulting in repeat of information from flights_mini.

What happens if you didn't know that "year" was in both datasets?

```{r}
left_join(flights_mini, weather, by = c("month", "day", "origin"))
```

The "year" variable from flights_mini has been renamed "year.x", and "year" 
from "weather" has been renamed "year.y". (Whenever this happens, variables 
ending in ".x" come from the first table, while those ending in ".y" come from
the other table.)

#### > key variable with different names

We can also match on a key that has a different name in the related tables 
(although its values are the same). The variable "faa" in airports is equivalent
to flights_mini's "dest" variable. Here are three ways of getting the same result.

```{r}
## matching key name in the `by`
left_join(flights_mini, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))

## renaming key in a select
left_join(flights_mini, airports %>% rename(dest = faa), by = "dest")

## syntax with pipe operator
flights_mini %>% left_join(airports %>% rename(dest = faa))

```

## Other mutating joins

We have only been working with left joins so far. The idea is exactly the same 
for full, right and inner joins.

* `full_join(x, y, by)`  - everything!

* `right_join(x, y, by)` - equivalent to left_join(y, x, by), but the columns and rows will be ordered differently

* `inner_join(x, y, by)` - only rows found in both

The difference is what you end up with.

Let's create two small datasets to compare the results of the above types of joins.
Both tables have an ID column -- this is our key -- and one other variable. 

```{r}
tbl1 <- tibble(ID = c("ID_1", "ID_2", "ID_3", "ID_4", "ID_5", "ID_6"),
              activity1 = c("cycling", "basketball", "kung fu", "reading", "running", "skating"))
tbl2 <- tibble(ID = c("ID_2", "ID_4", "ID_6", "ID_8"), 
              place2 = c("outside court", "library", "rec center", "pool"))

tbl1
tbl2
```

```{r}
left_join(tbl1, tbl2, by = "ID")
right_join(tbl2, tbl1, by = "ID")
right_join(tbl1, tbl2, by = "ID")
full_join(tbl1, tbl2, by = "ID")
inner_join(tbl1, tbl2, by = "ID")
```

> </details>

## Filtering joins

In Challenge 2, we could have done a semi join instead of an inner join. That is,
we were essentially filtering the 'flights_mini' dataset to get only those flights
that occurred on days where the average temperature was below 32F. We didn't
do anything with the actual temperature other than drop observations; therefore,
we didn't actually need the 'mean_temp' variable.

```{r}
flights_mini %>% semi_join(freezing, by = c("month", "day"))
```

That is what happens with **filtering joins**: observations from one table are 
filtered based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table, 
but no information is brought in from the other table. Specifically, **semi joins**
return all rows in x with a match in y, while **anti joins** return all rows in x 
without a match in y. Note, that the syntax for filtering joins is the same: 
`xxx_join(x, y, by = "key_variable")`.
