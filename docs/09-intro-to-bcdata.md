# Introduction to the bcdata package


The British Columbia government hosts over 2000 tabular and geospatial data sets
in the B.C. Data Catalogue. Most data is available through the B.C. Data
Catalogue under an open licence. The `bcdata` package provides programming
interfaces the B.C. Data Catalogue.  This allows R users to search, download and
import metadata and data from the B.C. Data Catalogue into their R session.
Through this functionality the `bcdata` package connects British Columbia
government public data holdings in the B.C. Data Catalogue with the vast
capabilities of R.


## Getting started

First we need to install the `bcdata` package:


```r
install.packages("bcdata")
```

And next we need to load the `bcdata` package, along with `dplyr` and `ggplot2` which we installed and used in earlier lessons:


```r
library(bcdata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Searching the B.C. Data Catalogue

Let's use the `bcdata` package to search the B.C. Data Catalogue for some data on _**public libraries**_ in British Columbia:


```r
bcdc_search("public libraries")
```

```

Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID
 from the desired record.
```

There are many catalogue records with data relating to libraries. Let's examine the first returned record more closely:


```r
bcdc_get_record("bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations")
```

```
Warning: It is advised to use the permanent id ('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f') rather than the name of the record ('bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations') to guard against future name changes.
```

B.C. Data Catalogue Record: BC Public Libraries Systems - Branches and
 Locations
Name: bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations (ID:

Permalink:
 https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f
Licence: Open Government Licence - British Columbia
Description: This dataset includes contact and location data for all
 library service points in BC. It also includes some primary data on
 library use and services from the most current year that data is
 available.   The dataset is geolocational, and is available in XLSX,
 CSV, and KML formats.
Available Resources (5):
 1. BC Public Library Service Points (csv)
 2. 2018 BC Public Library Systems - Locations and Branch Data (XLS) - v19 (xlsx)
 3. 2018 BC Public Library Systems - Locations and Branch Data (CSV) - v19 (csv)
 4. 2015 BC Public Library Systems - Locations and Branch Data 1.2 (KML) (kml)
 5. WMS getCapabilities request (wms)
Access the full 'Resources' data frame using:
 bcdc_tidy_resources('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f')
Query and filter this data using:
 bcdc_query_geodata('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f')
```

## Importing data from the B.C. Data Catalogue

Next, we can use the `bcdc_get_data` function to import this data directly into R: 


```r
bcdc_get_data(record = "bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations")
```


The _bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations_ catalogue record contains multiple data resources or files. If we run the above code interactively, R will prompt you in the console to select one of the available resources, as it does not know which one you want to download. The full code to import the resource from the record&mdash;using the record's permanent id to guard against future name changesname&mdash;is provided to the user for next time:


```r
lib_raw <- bcdc_get_data('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f',
                         resource = 'ed17f111-fb39-46b3-89aa-5375592fbb01')
```

```
Reading the data using the read_xlsx function from the readxl package.
```

> ## Challenge 1 (5 minutes)
>
> Take a few minutes to search the B.C. Data Catalogue for data sets for a different topic. Identify and import one tabular data set into your R session > (e.g. a CSV or XLS resource). Entering `bcdc_browse()` into the R console will open the catalogue page in your default web browser. 
>

## Practice manipulating data with `dplyr`  


Let's return to the libraries data frame `lib_raw` we imported. As we learned earlier in the workshop, a useful first step is to get familiar with the data:


```r
str(lib_raw)
```

```

Let's tidy up this data frame and find out how many books&mdash;physical materials or volumes&mdash;are available within each City:


```r
library(dplyr)

lib_tidy <- lib_raw %>%
  select(`Library System`, Location, City, num_books = "460x Total branch physical materials, volumes held")


sum_books <- lib_tidy %>% 
  group_by(City, `Library System`) %>% 
  summarize(total_books = sum(num_books))
```

```
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'City'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
```

## Practice plotting data with `ggplot2`  

Now that we have imported, tidied, and summarized our library data, let's make a static data visualization to share and communicate the results with others.


```r
library(ggplot2)

sum_books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(total_books, City)) +
  geom_col()
```

<img src="fig/rmd-09-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

```r
sum_books %>% 
  filter(total_books > 100000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(total_books, City)) +
  geom_col()
```

<img src="fig/rmd-09-unnamed-chunk-11-2.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
