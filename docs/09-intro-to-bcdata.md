# Introduction to the bcdata package


The British Columbia government hosts over 2000 tabular and geospatial data sets
in the B.C. Data Catalogue. Most data is available through the B.C. Data
Catalogue under an open licence. The `bcdata` package provides programming
interfaces the B.C. Data Catalogue.  This allows R users to search, download and
import metadata and data from the B.C. Data Catalogue into their R session.
Through this functionality the `bcdata` package connects British Columbia
government public data holdings in the B.C. Data Catalogue with the vast
capabilities of R.


## Getting started

First we need to install the `bcdata` package:


```r
install.packages("bcdata")
```

And next we need to load the `bcdata` package, along with `dplyr` and `ggplot2` which we installed and used in earlier lessons:


```r
library(bcdata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Searching the B.C. Data Catalogue

Let's use the `bcdata` package to search the B.C. Data Catalogue for some data on _**public libraries**_ in British Columbia:


```r
bcdc_search("public libraries")
```

```

 Name:
  predictive-ecosystem-mapping-pem-detailed-polygons-with-short-attribute-table-20-000-spatial-view

Access a single record by calling `bcdc_get_record(ID)` with the ID
 from the desired record.
```

There are many catalogue records with data relating to libraries. Let's examine the first returned record more closely:


```r
bcdc_get_record("bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations")
```

```
Warning: It is advised to use the permanent id ('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f') rather than the name of the record ('bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations') to guard against future name changes.
```

B.C. Data Catalogue Record: BC Public Libraries Systems - Branches and
 Locations
Name: bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations (ID:
 3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f)
Permalink:
 https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f
Licence: Open Government Licence - British Columbia
Description: This dataset includes contact and location data for all
 library service points in BC. It also includes some primary data on
 library use and services from the most current year that data is
 available.   The dataset is geolocational, and is available in XLSX,
 CSV, and KML formats.
Available Resources (5):
 1. BC Public Library Service Points (csv)
 2. 2018 BC Public Library Systems - Locations and Branch Data (XLS) - v19 (xlsx)
 3. 2018 BC Public Library Systems - Locations and Branch Data (CSV) - v19 (csv)
 4. 2015 BC Public Library Systems - Locations and Branch Data 1.2 (KML) (kml)
 5. WMS getCapabilities request (wms)
Access the full 'Resources' data frame using:
 bcdc_tidy_resources('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f')
Query and filter this data using:
 bcdc_query_geodata('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f')
```

## Importing data from the B.C. Data Catalogue

Next, we can use the `bcdc_get_data()` function to import this data directly into R: 


```r
bcdc_get_data(record = "bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations")
```


The _bc-public-libraries-systems-branches-and-locations_ catalogue record contains multiple data resources or files. If we run the above code interactively, R will prompt you in the console to select one of the available resources, as it does not know which one you want to download. The full code to import the resource from the record&mdash;using the record's permanent id to guard against future name changesname&mdash;is provided to the user for next time:


```r
lib_raw <- bcdc_get_data('3d2318d4-8f5d-4208-88f5-995420d7c58f',
                         resource = 'ed17f111-fb39-46b3-89aa-5375592fbb01')
```

```
Reading the data using the read_xlsx function from the readxl package.
```

### Challenge 1 (5 minutes)
>
> Take a few minutes to search the B.C. Data Catalogue for data sets for a different topic. Identify and import one tabular data set into your R session > (e.g. a CSV or XLS resource). Entering `bcdc_browse()` into the R console will open the catalogue page in your default web browser. 


## Practice manipulating data with `dplyr`  


Let's return to the libraries data frame `lib_raw` we imported. As we learned earlier in the workshop, a useful first step is to get familiar with the data:


```r
str(lib_raw)
```

```

Let's tidy up this data frame and find out how many books&mdash;physical materials or volumes&mdash;are available within each City:


```r
library(dplyr)

lib_tidy <- lib_raw %>%
  select(`Library System`, Location, City, num_books = "460x Total branch physical materials, volumes held")


sum_books <- lib_tidy %>% 
  group_by(City, `Library System`) %>% 
  summarize(total_books = sum(num_books))
```

```
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'City'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
```

## Practice plotting data with `ggplot2`  

Now that we have imported, tidied, and summarized our library data, let's make a static data visualization to share and communicate the results with others.


```r
library(ggplot2)

sum_books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(total_books, City)) +
  geom_col()
```

<img src="fig/rmd-09-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


```r
sum_books %>% 
  filter(total_books > 100000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(total_books, City)) +
  geom_col()
```

<img src="fig/rmd-09-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Challenge 3 (10 minutes)

> Iterate the above plot to include information on the number of books by Library Service. Add a title to the plot. Try other design changes to make the plot more readable.

## Importing data from the B.C. Data Catalogue - Another Example
Let's try another example with `bcdata`. This time we are going to try importing
some data that is a bit messier. We are going to work with [_New Apprenticeship
Registrations by Fiscal Year and
Gender_](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/87f26989-ccde-407e-a500-5f0c304c460d)
data. This example will require you to reference elements you've learned
throughout the workshop.

You can view the data record we are going to be working with in your browser by
running the following command:


```r
bcdc_browse("new-apprenticeship-registrations-by-fiscal-year-and-gender")
```

As we've previously learned we can use `bcdc_get_data()` to load data from the B.C. Data Catalogue directly into R. Let's try that now:


```r
new_reg <- bcdc_get_data("new-apprenticeship-registrations-by-fiscal-year-and-gender")
```

```
Reading the data using the read_csv function from the readr package.
```

```
New names:
* `` -> ...2
* `` -> ...3
* `` -> ...4
* `` -> ...5
* `` -> ...6
* ...
```

Well this doesn't look right. We can see near the bottom of our output that
there are the words of `Gender` and `Trade` but we also have this mess of `NAs`.
In this scenario it can be helpful to look at the raw data. Navigate back to the
catalogue page you opened earlier and click the <kbd>View</kbd> button. This
will take you to the
[Resource](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/87f26989-ccde-407e-a500-5f0c304c460d/resource/8f4f1f19-9027-4d0b-a686-d820bccddd16)
page. Click the link under **Resource** and the data will open up in Excel. The
first thing we notice is that the data does not actually start until 10 rows
down. `bcdc_get_data()` use `read_csv()` to read csv files and that function
conveniently has an argument called `skip` which allows us to specify the number
of lines to skip before reading the data. We can use it with `bcdc_get_data()`
like this:


```r
new_reg <- bcdc_get_data(
  "new-apprenticeship-registrations-by-fiscal-year-and-gender", 
  skip = 9
  )
```

```
Reading the data using the read_csv function from the readr package.

Ok this is looking _much_ better. We now have data that is rectangular and looks more like something we can work with. We do have one more little thing to take care of though. You will notice the data is filled with `...`. Those are missing values in the data. R has a specific way of handling missing values and we need to tell `bcdc_get_data()` (via `read_csv()`) that those are missing values. We do this by adding another argument:


```r
new_reg <- bcdc_get_data(
  "new-apprenticeship-registrations-by-fiscal-year-and-gender", 
  skip = 9, 
  na = "..."
  )
```

```
Reading the data using the read_csv function from the readr package.

```

Now we are ready to work with this data. One thing you might notice is that this data is in _wide_ format. The number of individuals of a given `Gender` and `Trade` are repeated over time across _columns_ with each column being a fiscal year. This is great for making a nice table but less great if we want to make a plot. To reshape the data into long format, we can again make use of `pivot_longer` from the `tidyr` package. We only want to pivot the fiscal years so we need to specify those columns. In addition, we want to name our two new columns:


```r
library(tidyr)

new_reg_long <- new_reg %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `FY2011/12`:`FY2020/21`,
    names_to = "fiscal_year",
    values_to = "registrations"
  )
new_reg_long
```

```
# A tibble: 3,320 Ã— 4
   Trade                           Gender fiscal_year registrations
   <chr>                           <chr>  <chr>               <dbl>

 2 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2012/13               8
 3 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2013/14               7
 4 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2014/15               9
 5 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2015/16               6
 6 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2016/17              NA
 7 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2017/18              NA
 8 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2018/19              NA
 9 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2019/20              12
10 Aircraft Maintenance Technician Women  FY2020/21              NA
# â€¦ with 3,310 more rows
```

There is actually quite a bit of data here while likely represents the number possible values for `Trade`. We can check the number of unique values in the `Trade` column using a handy function from `dplyr` called `n_distinct()`:


```r
n_distinct(new_reg_long$Trade)
```

```
[1] 111
```

Sure enough there are 111 of them! Similarly, let's have a look at what values are in the `Gender` column using the `unique()` function you learned earlier:


```r
unique(new_reg_long$Gender)
```

```
[1] "Women"                     "Men"                      
[3] "Total (Women+Men)"         "Non-Disclosed/Unspecified"
[5] "Grand Total"              
```

To simplify things let's take a subset of the Trades in the data and only look at Men and Women:

```r
new_reg_long <- new_reg %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `FY2011/12`:`FY2020/21`,
    names_to = "fiscal_year",
    values_to = "registrations", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    Gender %in% c("Men", "Women"),
    Trade %in% c("Boilermaker", "Climbing Arborist", "Tilesetter", "Landscape Horticulturist","Baker")
    )
```

With this tidied and filtered dataset, we now have something that we can plot using the skills we've learned with ggplot2. One thing to note is that we made use of the `ncol` argument in `facet_wrap()` so that the faceted plots would share the x-axis:


```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(new_reg_long, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = registrations, fill = Trade)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Gender), ncol = 1)
```

Try customizing the output with different `Trade` categories or different ggplot2 customizations. For example what strategies might you take to tidy up the x-axis.
