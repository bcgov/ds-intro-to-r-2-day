# Dataframe Manipulation with dplyr






## The `dplyr` package






## Using select()







## Using filter()







## Using filter() with pipes



## Challenge 1
## Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes)
## that will produce a dataframe that has the African values for lifeExp,
## country and year, but not for other Continents. How many rows does your
## dataframe have and why?





## Using group_by() and summarize()







## Using summarize()







## Challenge 2
## Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life
## expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?

## Using count()







## Using mutate()







## Connect mutate with logical groupings: ifelse







## Combining `dplyr` and `ggplot2`








# ## Advanced Challenge
#
# Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected countries
# for each continent. Then arrange the continent names in reverse order.
# **Hint:** Use the `dplyr` functions `arrange()` and `sample_n()`, they have
# similar syntax to other dplyr functions.
